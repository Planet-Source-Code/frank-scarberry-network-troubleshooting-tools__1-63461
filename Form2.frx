ÿ’TRACEROUTE

(tras´rowt) (n.) A utility that traces a packet from your 
computer to an Internet host, showing how many hops the 
packet requires to reach the host and how long each hop 
takes. If you're visiting a Web site and pages are 
appearing slowly, you can use traceroute to figure out 
where the longest delays are occurring. 
The original traceroute is a UNIX utility, but nearly all 
platforms have something similar. Windows includes a 
traceroute utility called tracert. In Windows, you can run 
tracert by selecting Start->Run, and then entering tracert 
followed by the domain name of the host. For example: 

tracert www.pcwebopedia.com 

Traceroute utilities work by sending packets with low 
time-to-live (TTL) fields. The TTL value specifies how 
many hops the packet is allowed before it is returned. 
When a packet can't reach its destination because the 
TTL value is too low, the last host returns the packet and 
identifies itself. By sending a series of packets and 
incrementing the TTL value with each successive packet, 
traceroute finds out who all the intermediary hosts are.
